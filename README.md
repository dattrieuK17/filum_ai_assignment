Go to this link to download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

### 2. Clone the repository and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dattrieuK17/filum_ai_assignment.git
cd filum_ai_assignment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate         # On Unix/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start Weaviate service
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Run
Run without UI: Run All in `full_pipeline.ipynb `  

Run with UI:
```bash
python app.py
```
and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
